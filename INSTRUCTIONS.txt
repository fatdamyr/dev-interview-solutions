You are implementing the start of a "Catalog Management System."  You will be implementing a few of the initial methods in the
basic "CatalogManager" interface.  You are being provided with the java interface.

The key technologies you will use in this exercise include Java, Maven, Spring and JUnit.  

-------------------------------
You need to do the following
-------------------------------

	---------------------------
	Bare Minimum
	---------------------------
	1) Implement the interface and create a unit test to test it
	
	---------------------------
	Ideal (do this if you can)
	---------------------------
	1) Create a Maven POM & Maven project for your implementation, placing the code you were provided into the project
	2) Implement the interface
	3) Create a Spring Config (ideally Java instead of XML) to load your interface implementation as a singleton Spring bean
	4) Create a JUnit test and wire/inject the Spring Bean into the unit test
	5) zip your project after complete and attach it in a reply to the email originally sent to you

-------------------------------
A few pointers/notes
-------------------------------
	1) Do NOT alter the interface itself at all (including no packaging changes)
	2) Read the requirements that exist as JavaDocs in the interface
	3) Feel free to design your solution however you see fit
	4) There does not need to be any persistence beyond inside of your Spring Bean (data gone once the JVM shuts down).  
	5) Use whatever IDE or editor you desire.  The dev machine we provide, if you choose to use it, has Eclipse and Netbeans installed.
	6) Feel free to use Google or similar sources to help complete the work, however you may not "phone a friend"

Good Luck!
